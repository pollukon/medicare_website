This project uses the base HTML/CSS layout prepared by the student.

All PHP backend code for CRUD operations (patients, doctors, records) was written by the student for educational purposes.

No external open-source code was copied or reused in the backend logic.

If any additional external templates or libraries are added later, they should be listed here with source links.
